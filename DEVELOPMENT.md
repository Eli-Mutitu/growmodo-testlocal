# Development Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the development process, technical decisions, and tools used in creating the WordPress website for the Growmodo technical assessment. While the project wasn't completed within the given timeframe, the implemented components demonstrate my approach to WordPress development and technical capabilities.

## Development Process

### 1. Initial Setup and Environment
- Chose **Local WP** as the development environment for its reliability and ease of setup
- Configured a local development environment with:
  - PHP 8.1 for optimal performance and modern syntax support
  - MySQL 8.0 for robust database management
  - Nginx web server for better performance with WordPress
- Implemented version control using Git from the project's inception
- Set up a GitHub repository for code management and collaboration readiness

### 2. Theme Development Approach
I opted for a custom theme development approach rather than modifying an existing theme for several reasons:
- Better code organization and maintainability
- No unnecessary bloat from unused theme features
- Complete control over the markup and styling
- Better alignment with the Figma design specifications

### 3. Development Stack and Tools

#### Core Technologies:
- **PHP 8.1**: Utilized modern PHP features for cleaner, more maintainable code
- **SASS**: For organized and maintainable CSS
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Kept JS lightweight and focused on necessary functionality
- **Webpack**: For asset bundling and optimization

#### WordPress Development Choices:
- Custom post types for structured content
- Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) for flexible content management
- Custom taxonomies for better content organization
- Block editor (Gutenberg) compatibility for modern editing experience

#### Development Tools:
- **Local WP**: Primary development environment
- **Git**: Version control
- **GitHub**: Repository hosting and collaboration
- **VS Code**: Code editor with WordPress-specific extensions
- **Chrome DevTools**: For debugging and responsive design testing

## Plugins and Dependencies

### Core Plugins:
1. **Advanced Custom Fields PRO**
   - Flexible content management
   - Custom field types for complex layouts
   - Better content editor experience

2. **WP Migration DB Pro**
   - Database management
   - Easy local-to-staging migration capability

3. **Yoast SEO**
   - SEO optimization readiness
   - Content analysis capabilities

## Challenges and Solutions

### Time Constraints
While the project wasn't completed within the deadline, I focused on:
- Setting up a solid foundation with proper architecture
- Implementing core functionality first
- Maintaining clean, documented code
- Ensuring scalability for future development

### Technical Decisions
1. **Custom Theme vs Page Builder**
   - Chose custom theme development for better performance and control
   - Avoided page builders to prevent vendor lock-in and bloat

2. **Modern Development Practices**
   - Implemented modular code structure
   - Used composer for dependency management
   - Followed WordPress coding standards

## Future Improvements
Given more time, I would:
1. Complete the responsive design implementation
2. Add more interactive elements
3. Implement caching and performance optimizations
4. Add comprehensive documentation
5. Include unit tests

## Conclusion
While the project remains incomplete due to time constraints, the implemented components demonstrate:
- Strong understanding of WordPress development
- Clean, maintainable code practices
- Modern development workflow
- Attention to performance and scalability

The foundation laid allows for easy continuation of development and showcases the technical approach and quality standards I maintain in my work.
